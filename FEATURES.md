Title: "This software is terrible and keeps crashing"
Result: Category = "Pain Points", Confidence = 0.95

# Solution Request Example  
Title: "What's the best budget laptop for programming?"
Result: Category = "Solution Requests", Confidence = 0.88

# Money Talk Example
Title: "Is this $200 subscription worth it for small business?"
